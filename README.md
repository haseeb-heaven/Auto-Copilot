**Auto Copilot** is an _extraordinary_ 🌟🔧 automation tool that monitors your code file and automatically fixes errors. 🚀💡 
and give you **Real-time** 📺 output of your code. 🎯🔧💻 just at your fingertips. 🤩👌

Unbelievable, right? It's like having a _copilot_ 🚁👨‍✈️ that **never sleeps**! 😎🌙✨

This tool was inspired by [**XCode**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), which _automatically executes_ your code in Playground 🎮, and [**Compiler Explorer**](https://godbolt.org/), which _automatically compiles_ your code after every change. 🎯🔧💻


## Features ✨

- **File Monitoring** 📂: Auto Copilot watches your file for changes and automatically fixes errors.
- **Live Preview** 📺: Auto Copilot can execute your code automatically after fixing the error and show you the output live.
- **Customizable** 🎛️: You can set the interval time and monitor time according to your needs.
- **Easy to Use** 🚀: Just run the script with your file as an argument and let Auto Copilot handle the rest.
- **Cross Platform** 🌍: Auto Copilot works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

## Pre-requisites 📝

You need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

And you need to have the following compilers installed on your system:
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [Swift](https://swift.org/)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)

In order to execute your code automatically and for the live preview.

### Github Copilot 🔑
And you need to have **Github Copilot** installed on your VS Code. You can download it from [here](https://copilot.github.com/).
Basically Auto Copilot uses Github Copilot Chat **Inline** version to fix the errors and bugs in your code.

And don't forget to set the **keybindings** for Github Copilot Chat in your VS Code. 🔑

## Installation 💻

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autocopilot.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd autocopilot
    ```

3. Run the script with your file as an argument:
    ```sh
    python auto-copilot.py filename [interval_time] [monitor_time]
    ```

    - `filename`: The name of the file you want to monitor.
    - `interval_time` (optional): The time interval in seconds for checking the file. Default is 5 seconds.
    - `monitor_time` (optional): The time in seconds for the auto fix error. Default is 15 seconds.

4. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Make sure to run this throug your terminal or cmd. 🎯🔧💻 and always give permissions to your terminal or cmd to access your VS Code. 🔑

## Working 🚀
So how does Auto Copilot work? 🤔
- It actualyy uses the **Github Copilot Chat** to fix the errors in your code. 🎯🔧💻
- It Reads your **Github Copilot** Keybindings from your VS Code. 🔑
- It then **compiles** your code and **executes** it. 🎯🔧💻
- Then on **Error & Bugs** occurences it press the **Github Copilot** Keybindings to fix the errors. 🔑
- And then it **compiles** and **executes** your code again. 🎯🔧💻
- And it keeps on doing this until there are no errors left in your code. 🎯🔧💻
- And it also gives you the **Real-time** 📺 output of your code. 🎯🔧💻
