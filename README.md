# Auto Copilot 🌙✨

**Auto Copilot** is an _extraordinary_ 🌟🔧 automation tool that monitors your code file and automatically fixes errors. 🚀💡 
and give you **Real-time** 📺 output of your code. 🎯🔧💻 just at your fingertips. 🤩👌

Unbelievable, right? It's like having a _copilot_ 🚁👨‍✈️ that **never sleeps**! 😎🌙✨

This tool was inspired by [**XCode**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), which _automatically executes_ your code in Playground 🎮, and [**Compiler Explorer**](https://godbolt.org/), which _automatically compiles_ your code after every change. 🎯🔧💻

- **Easy to Use** 🚀: Just run the script with your file as an argument and let Auto Copilot handle the rest.
- **Cross Platform** 🌍: Auto Copilot works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
- **Live Preview** 📺: Auto Copilot can execute your code automatically after fixing the error and show you the output live.
